## Introduction

What is a knowledge graph? — A knowledge graph is a knowledge base that uses graph data structure to store and represent data that emphasizes the relationships between entities.

What is the structure? — The knowledge graph is made up of three components: nodes, edges, and labels.

Nodes => entities
Edges => relationships
Labels => type

The graph structure is very flexible and provides an alternative means of representing models of the world more conveniently than tabular structures.

- Deep relationships are "free" (i.e., a component in the database) in knowledge graphs and provide more efficient querying
- Knowledge graphs for RAG provides more flexibility over similarity functions and retrieves a wide range of information
